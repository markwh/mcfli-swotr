I'm going to try out using google compute engine and docker to run stan models. 

Following [this guide](https://cloudyr.github.io/googleComputeEngineR/articles/massive-parallel.html)


```{r}
library(future)
library(googleComputeEngineR)

gce_get_project()

vm_names <- c("vm1", "vm2", "vm3")

my_docker <- gce_tag_container("rstan-image", project = "testproject1-179318")


jobs <- lapply(vm_names, function(x) {
  gce_vm_template(template = "dynamic", predefined_type = "n1-higmem-2", 
                  name = x,
                  dynamic_image = my_docker, wait = FALSE)
})

vms <- lapply(vm_names, gce_wait)
```
