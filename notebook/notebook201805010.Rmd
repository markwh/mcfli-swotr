Checking up on log-likelihood function for A0 from bam-like formulation. It's got to have downward concavity, but I can't get that to come out! Unless third term forces everything to be negative. Here's what I have:

```{r}
nll.. <- function(swotlist, reachno) {
  dAi <- swotlist$dA[reachno, ]
  xi <- 1/2 * log(swotlist$S[reachno, ]) - 2/3 * log(swotlist$W[reachno, ])
  
  outfun <- function(A0, logQn, sigma) {
    Ai <- dAi + A0
    mu <- logQn - 5/3 * log(Ai)
    
    term1 <- 5/(3 * sigma^2) * sum(1 / Ai)
    term2 <- 5/3 * sum(1 / Ai^2)
    term3 <- 5 / (3 * sigma^2) * sum((xi - mu) / Ai^2)
    
    out <- term1 + term2 + term3
    out
    }
}

nll1 <- nll..(reachdata$Po, 3)

nll1(1400, 5, 1)
```
