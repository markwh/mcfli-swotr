# The McFLI-SWOT-R ecosystem

This project is a pass-through development for the eventual McFLI-SWOT-R ecosystem of R packages. Currently (3/23/2018), it is a combination of parts from two earlier projects--A0_identifiability and manningEval. Eventually these pieces will be further developed, sorted, and packaged as an ecosystem of R packages for dealing with SWOT-like data and performing McFLI inference thereon. 

Log:

- manningEval renamed to mcfli-swotr
- A0_identifiability/graphs/* later than 1/1/2018 moved to ./graphs
- A0_identifiability/notebook/* copied to ./notebook
- A0_identifiability/reports/* later than 2/1/2018 moved to ./reports
- A0_identifiability/lib/* except likvis.R copied to ./lib
- A0_identifiability/lisflood copied to ./
