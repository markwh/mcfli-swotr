### Problem setup

Assume we have measurements of slope, width, and partial cross-section area for T times and N locations within a mass-conserved river segment. Then we can write


$$
\begin{aligned}
Q_{it} &= \frac{1}{n} W_{it}^{-2/3} A_{it}^{5/3}S_{it}^{1/2} \\
\implies Q^{3/5}_{it} & = A_{it}\Big(\frac{1}{n} W_{it}^{-2/3} S_{it}^{1/2} \Big)^{3/5}
\end{aligned}
$$
For simplicity let $x_{it} = \Big(\frac{1}{n} W_{it}^{-2/3} S_{it}^{1/2} \Big)^{3/5}$, so that $Q^{3/5}_{it} = A_{it}x_{it}$. 



### 2. Linearize

The linearization to isolate $Q$ is necessarily different from that to isolate $A_0$. This is at the heart of the difference in inferrability of these two quantities. 

From the above, we have
$$
Q^{3/5}_{it} = A_{it}x_{it} = (A_{0,i} + \delta A_{it}) x_{it}
$$


Note that this equation is linear in both $A_{0,i}$ and $Q_{it}$. 

### 3. Mass conserve


Steady-state mass conservation requires that $Q_{it} = Q_{i't}$ for all $i, i'$ in $1, 2, ..., N$. This is equivalent to  
$$
\sum_{i = 1}^N\omega_i A_{it} x_{it} = 0
$$
for any set of $\omega_i$'s such that $\sum_{i = 1}^N \omega_i = 0$. In matrix notation, this is


$$
(\mathbf{A} \circ \mathbf{X}) \mathbf{\omega} = \mathbf{0}
$$
where $\circ$ denotes the elementwise product. We can now split this into the unobserved and observed parts of area:
$$
((\mathbf{A_0} + \mathbf{\delta A}) \circ \mathbf{X}) \mathbf{\omega} = (\mathbf{A_0} \circ \mathbf{X}) \omega + (\mathbf{\delta A} \circ \mathbf{X}) \mathbf{\omega} =  \mathbf{0} \\
\implies (\mathbf{A_0} \circ \mathbf{X}) \omega = (-\delta \mathbf{A} \circ \mathbf{X}) \omega
$$
A little math shows that the following representations of the LHS are equivalent:
$$
(\mathbf{A}_0 \circ \mathbf{X}) \omega = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{\Omega} \mathbf{a}_0 = \mathbf{X} (\mathbf{\omega} \circ \mathbf{a_0})
$$
where $\mathbf{\Omega}$ is the diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the elements of $\mathbf{\omega}$ and $\mathbf{a_0}$ is the the vector of $A_0$'s that is repeated to form the matrix $\mathbf{A_0}$, i.e. 


$$
\mathbf{A_0} = 

\begin{bmatrix} 

{a_0} \\
{a_0} \\
\vdots \\
{a_0} \\

\end{bmatrix}

= 

\begin{bmatrix} 

A_{0,1} & A_{0,2} & ... & A_{0,N} \\
A_{0,1} & A_{0,2} & ... & A_{0,N} \\
\vdots \\
A_{0,1} & A_{0,2} & ... & A_{0,N} \\


\end{bmatrix}
$$


### 4. Inference procedure

Given the above, the vector $\mathbf{a_0}$ can be inferred by solving the following linear model:


$$
\mathbf{X} \mathbf{\Omega} \mathbf{a}_0 = (-\delta \mathbf{A} \circ \mathbf{X}) \omega
$$

The model matrix, $\mathbf{X \Omega}$, may conceivably have fewer rows than columns; inference can be aided by selecting multiple $\omega$ vectors and appending the system as follows:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{X} \mathbf{\Omega_1} \\
\mathbf{X} \mathbf{\Omega_2} \\
\vdots \\
\mathbf{X} \mathbf{\Omega_n}
\end{bmatrix}
 \mathbf{a}_0

= 

\begin{bmatrix}
(-\delta \mathbf{A} \circ \mathbf{X}) \omega_1 \\
(-\delta \mathbf{A} \circ \mathbf{X}) \omega_2 \\
\vdots \\
(-\delta \mathbf{A} \circ \mathbf{X}) \omega_n

\end{bmatrix}


$$

### 5. Application to Pepsi datasets

Some results on Pepsi cases.

Relative error by case:

Relative error with linear model $R^2$:

Interestingly, the relative error on slope inference does not have a strong correlation with model fit. 

Here is the model fit for all cases (that didn't produce errors):

Some other points:

- Not related to mass conservation / steady-state assumptions
- Manning's equation appears to fit relatively well in all cases. 


#### Clues as to what is affecting fit

Inspecting the relationships between variables in log space reveals some nonlinear relationships (which would mean nonmultiplicative in linear space). This appears to be a violation of Manning's equation assumptions. 

- Here's Po (poor linear model fit but good A0 inference):
