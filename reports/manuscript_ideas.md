It's time to change gears and start preparing manuscripts. I have the following ideas. 



First, using Pepsi 1 (or eventually Pepsi 2) cases to probe applicability of flow laws even when parameters are known. Potential investigations: 

- Compare at-a-location Manning against hydrodynamic model
- Mass-conserved Manning against hydrodynamic model
- AHG against hydrodynamic, AMHG against hydrodynamic



Second, using Pepsi 1 or both 1 and 2 to characterize and decompose errors in treating Manning's n as a constant. Could be blended with first idea. 



Third, a presentation of different methods for estimating A0. Could be a shorter technical report. Cover methods: linear model, nonlinear optimization/maximum likelihood, Bayesian methods. Demonstrate using Pepsi cases. Show effect of SWOT-like noise, SWOT-like sampling frequency



Fourth, information content of SWOT-like data for different parameters. Namely, Q, n, Qn, A0. For non-identifiable parameters, what is the impact of data versus the priors? This would be a math-heavy document at the limits of my capacity. 



Fifth, a short communique addressing SWOT ability to estimate dQ/dx using dA/dt as a function of overpass interval. Are there places where this is a reasonable prospect? Could be integrated into idea 1. 



Conclusion: right now I think best to take ideas 1, 2, and 5 as a single manuscript. Attempt now to make an outline.
