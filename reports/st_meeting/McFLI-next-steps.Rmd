## Proposed next steps for McFLI algorithms

1. Document! Disseminate!
2. Verify uncertainties
    - including parameters
3. Tabulate, formalize applicability cases
4. SWOT-realistic benchmarking
    - measurement error
    - sampling interval
5. Collaborative merging of algorithms/components?
6. Synthetic assumption-adherent datasets?
