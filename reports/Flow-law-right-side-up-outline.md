Outline of manuscript on abilities and limitations of McFLI  as illustrated using Pepsi cases.



## Introduction

Simplified channel and floodplain hydraulics are immensely useful, but they are simplifications of real-world physics. 

A recent, novel addition to the long list of applications are so-called McFLI (Mass-conserved flow-law inversion) algorithms meant to be used with remote-sensed river data. 

## Methods

### Datasets (Pepsi cases)

### Flow laws

### Mass conservation

#### Steady-state

#### dQ/dx = dA/dt

### Evaluation

metrics used



## Results

### Manning alone

Closure plots, log-log scatterplot, distribution of mean Manning n

summary of metrics, reference to big metrics table. 

### Mass-conserved Manning

Closure error as percent

Decomposition of closure error: ANOVA 

Decomposition of closure error: flow resistance vs flow imbalance

### AHG 

closure plots, log-log scatterplot, distribution of b

### AMHG

closure plots, log-log scatterplot (probably tiled with others), distribution of Qc, Wc (probably joined with distribution of b, n)

### Impact of measurement error

### Flow imbalance estimation using dA/dt



## Discussion

How useful are McFLI algorithms in the best case of no measurement error

## Conclusion
